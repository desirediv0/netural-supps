# E-Commerce Application Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our e-commerce platform, which is built using a modern tech stack with a Node.js backend and React frontend. The application enables users to browse products, manage their cart, place orders, and handle payments through a seamless user experience.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with these main components:

1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**

   - Single Page Application (SPA)
   - UI components built with Shadcn UI (based on Radix UI)
   - State management with React hooks
   - API integration through centralized service modules

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**

   - RESTful API endpoints
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Business logic in controllers
   - Route-based API organization

3. **Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)**

   - Relational database for structured e-commerce data
   - Prisma ORM for type-safe database access

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Integration with Razorpay for payment processing
   - Support for multiple payment methods (cards, UPI, etc.)
   - Cash on Delivery option

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend code is organized around these key concepts:

### 1. Component Structure

- **Pages**: Full page components representing routes
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Layouts**: Page layout templates

### 2. API Integration

- Centralized API client (`api.ts`)
- Service modules organized by domain (e.g., `userService.ts`, `adminService.ts`)
- Consistent error handling and response parsing

### 3. Routing

- React Router v6 for navigation
- Protected routes for authenticated sections
- Role-based access control

### 4. User Authentication Flow

```
Login/Register --> JWT Token --> Local Storage --> API Requests with Authorization Header
```

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture:

### 1. Routes Layer

- API endpoint definitions
- Request validation
- Authentication middleware
- Route-specific middleware

### 2. Controller Layer

- Business logic implementation
- Request processing
- Response formatting

### 3. Service Layer

- Core business logic
- Database operations
- External API integrations

### 4. Data Access Layer

- Prisma ORM for database operations
- Type-safe database queries

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support all e-commerce functionality:

- **User Management**: Users, addresses, authentication
- **Product Management**: Products, variants, categories, flavors, weights
- **Order Management**: Orders, order items, payment status
- **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking, inventory logs
- **Shopping Experience**: Cart, wishlist, reviews

## Key Flows

### Product Browsing and Search Flow

1. User navigates to products page
2. Frontend makes API call to fetch products
3. User can filter, sort, and search products
4. Product details are displayed with variant options

### Shopping Cart Flow

1. User adds items to cart (authenticated or guest)
2. Cart items stored in database for authenticated users
3. Cart contents retrieved on page load
4. Cart operations (add, update, remove) synced with backend

### Checkout Flow

1. User proceeds to checkout from cart
2. Address selection/creation
3. Payment method selection
4. Order creation in the backend
5. Payment processing (Razorpay integration)
6. Order confirmation and receipt

### Admin Panel Flow

1. Admin authentication
2. Dashboard with key metrics
3. Product, order, and user management
4. Inventory operations
5. Settings configuration

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh token mechanism
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation at both frontend and backend
4. **Payment Security**: PCI-compliant payment processing

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**: Indexes for common queries
2. **Caching**: Product and category data caching
3. **Image Optimization**: CDN for product images
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## Frontend-Backend Communication

All API communication follows these principles:

1. **RESTful Endpoints**: Resource-based URLs
2. **Standard Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true|false,
     "data": { ... },
     "message": "Success or error message"
   }
   ```
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with HTTP status codes
4. **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header

## Deployment Architecture

The application can be deployed using the following architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Static hosting with CDN (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. **Backend**: Node.js hosting (AWS, Heroku, etc.)
3. **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service
4. **Media**: Cloud storage for product images

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Server Logs**: API request/response logging
2. **Error Tracking**: Centralized error reporting
3. **Performance Monitoring**: API response times
4. **User Analytics**: Integration with analytics services

## Conclusion

This e-commerce platform is designed with scalability, maintainability, and user experience in mind. The architecture supports all standard e-commerce features while allowing for future expansion and customization.

Frontend developers should focus on understanding the API integration patterns and component structure to effectively contribute to the project.
